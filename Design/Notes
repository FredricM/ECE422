Design notes (stories)  

1.  Can create a user account with password that isn't already existing  
2.  Can create a group that isn't already existing  
3.  Can add a user to a group that isn't already in group  
4.  Can login with existing user  
5.  Be placed in homedirectory once logged in  
6.  Can create file  
7.  Can give permissions on the file to guest/group/specific users  
8.  Can modify file (read, rename, write, delete)  
9.  Can create directory  
10. Can give permissions on the directory to guest/group/specific users  
11. Can modify directory  
12. Can view other users file   
13. Can change directory to another user's "cd"  
14. Can view a list of directories/files with "ls" command  
15. Can logout of current account  
16. Can login with a guest account (not a member)  
17. Guest has no commands except "cd" "modify" and "ls"  
18. System encrypts all files and folders that the guest is viewing except permission files and folders for guest to modify  
19. Notify absent user of any changes of files/directories once they log back in  
20. Connect server to online(elasticsearch? or something) to save accounts/files/directories  

Additional idea:  
have master login that controls the creating of users and groups and adding users to groups.
